# Notes
main.py is the main implementation in python using lists whereas main_dict.py is very similar to main.py but it uses dictionaries for better performance.
# Run
```python
python3 main.py
```

# Run with dictionaries
```python
python3 main_dict.py
```
Note: json files are taken as input within the scripts, you do not have to pass them as arguments.
